Building this portfolio was a really good experience for me. I got to practice my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills while figuring out how to structure a website properly. It taught me how important it is to keep everything organized so that pages, images, and links all work correctly.

I also experienced a problem locating all the sources in different files, so I decided to combine everything into one folder. Another challenge was that whenever I took a screenshot, it always showed an extra tab, which I had to work around. I learned to double-check file paths and test my site often.

Creating this portfolio also gave me a chance to showcase my work in a way that looks good. I realized that design, navigation, and simplicity are really important because they make the site easier for people to use.

Overall, this project boosted my confidence in web development and gave me a neat platform to share what Iâ€™ve done so far. I also picked up some useful skills in using GitHub, which will help me a lot in future projects
